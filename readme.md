## Installation

You will need npm to install this stuff I dont know the other options
If you use windows I added quickstart scripts so you dont need to type anything



This is what you use to install tailwind
```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```
    
This is what you use to run tailwind
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i [input css file] -o [output css file] --watch
```
